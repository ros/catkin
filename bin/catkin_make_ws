# Runs catkin_make in your catkin workspace from any directory meaning you
# no longer have to cd back to ~/catkin_ws/
#
# NOTE: Environment variable $CATKIN_WS to be defined
# $ export CATKIN_WS=<root directory of your catkin workspace>
#
# Example usage:
#   $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/my_awesome_package
#   $ catkin_make_ws

    echo CATKIN_WS needs to be set to your catkin workspace
    echo Try running export CATKIN_WS=\<root directory of your catkin workspace\>
    echo To make this persistent, you can put this export in your bashrc file
