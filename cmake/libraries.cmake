# BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is a global cmake variable (usually defaults to on) 
# that determines the build type of libraries:
#   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html#variable:BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
# It defaults to shared.
#
# Our only current major use case for static libraries is
# via the mingw cross compiler, though embedded builds
# could be feasibly built this way also (largely untested).

# Windows/cmake make things difficult if building dll's. 
# These use RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY (aka bin) and can't be 
# distinguished from exe's. We want exe output directory to be
# in the package's local folder (see catkin_project) - but dlls 
# to be public - ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin.
# 
# This is an awful hack - we want to move away from redefining
# add_library style calls, but necessary until a better solution
# is available for windows. Alternatives are to set_target_properties
# on every lib (painful) or to make exe's public (name conflicts
# bound to arise).
