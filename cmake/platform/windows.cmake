# BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is a global cmake variable (usually defaults to on) 
# that determines the build type of libraries:
#   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html#variable:BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
# It defaults to shared.

# Make sure this is already defined as a cached variable (@sa tools/libraries.cmake)

# Windows/cmake make things difficult if building dll's. 
# By default:
#   .dll -> CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
#   .exe -> CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
#   .lib -> CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
#
# Subsequently, .dll's and .exe's use the same variable and by 
# default must be installed to the same place. Which is not
# what we want for catkin. We wish:
#
#   .dll -> CATKIN_GLOBAL_BIN_DESTINATION
#   .exe -> CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION
#   .lib -> CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION
#
# Since we can't put CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to
# two values at once, we have this ugly workaround here.
#
# Note - we want to move away from redefining
# add_library style calls, but necessary until a better solution
# is available for windows. Alternatives are to set_target_properties
# on every lib (painful) or to make exe's public (name conflicts
# bound to arise).
#
# Another feature that would be desirable, is to install .pdb's for
# debugging along with the library. Can't do that here as we do not
# know for sure if the library target is intended for installation
# or not. Might a good idea to have a script that searches for all
# pdb's under CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX and copies them over at the end
# of the cmake build.
