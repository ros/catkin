# BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is a global cmake variable (usually defaults to on) 
# that determines the build type of libraries:
#   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html#variable:BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
# It defaults to shared.
#
# Our only current major use case for static libraries is
# via the mingw cross compiler, though embedded builds
# could be feasibly built this way also (largely untested).

# Make sure this is already defined as a cached variable (@sa platform/windows.cmake)
