#!/usr/bin/env fish
# generated from catkin/cmake/template/setup.fish.in

# Sets various environment variables and sources additional environment hooks.
# It tries it's best to undo changes from a previously sourced setup file before.
# Supported command line options:
# --extend: skips the undoing of changes from a previously sourced setup file
# --local: only considers this workspace but not the chained ones
# In plain sh shell which doesn't support arguments for sourced scripts you can
# set the environment variable `CATKIN_SETUP_UTIL_ARGS=--extend/--local` instead.

# since this file is sourced either use the provided _CATKIN_SETUP_DIR
# or fall back to the destination set at configure time
