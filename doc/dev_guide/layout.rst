.. highlight:: catkin-sh

.. rubric:: Source directory

This page describes the intended layout of build and install folders, in particular with respect to the Filesystem Hierarchy standard (FHS).


e.g. for package 'pkg'::

   src/
      pkg/
         CMakeLists.txt
         package.xml  # contains inter-package and system dependencies
                      # as specified in `REP 127 <http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0127.html>`_

         include/
            pkg/
               header.hpp
               otherheader.hpp
         msg/
            PkgMsg.msg
         src/
            pkg/
               __init__.py
               module.py

               CMakeLists.txt
               source.cpp
         srv/

.. rubric:: Install directory

The layout of the install directory follows the `Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard>`_.

::

   /opt/ros/groovy/           # defined by the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
                              # very similar to the buildspace folder
                              # therefore in the following only the differences are mentioned

      CATKIN_WORKSPACE        # identifies folder as a catkin workspace
                              # the file is empty which indicates that it is an installspace

      lib/
         pythonX.Y/
            dist-packages/
               pkg/           # besides the generated Python code
                              # contains the Python source code of package

      include/                # besides the generated header files
                              # contains all header files from the source directories

      share/
         pkg/                 # further resources (i.e. icons) copied from source directory
            manifest.xml      # provide export information for legacy rosmake based stacks/packages
            action/
            msg/
               Foo.msg
               Bar.msg
            something.launch  # the rest is as the package installs it

      stacks/
         dry_stack1           # packages built via legacy rosmake
         dry_stack2           # packages built via legacy rosmake
