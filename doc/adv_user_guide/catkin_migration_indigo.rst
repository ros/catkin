Updating a catkin package for Indigo
====================================

If your catkin package is working in Groovy/Hydro it should be easy
to get it working in Indigo too.

Removed deprecated functions
----------------------------

The following CMake functions and macros which were deprecated before
have been removed from catkin in Indigo. Please replace them with
their replacement:

* ``add_gtest(..)`` => ``catkin_add_gtest(..)``
* ``add_nosetests(..)`` => ``catkin_add_nosetests(..)``
* ``download_test_data(url md5)`` => ``catkin_download_test_data(target url MD5 md5)``
* ``parse_arguments(..)`` => ``cmake_parse_arguments(..)``

Removed Eigen CMake config file
-------------------------------

The previously provided CMake config file for Eigen has been removed.
Instead you might want to use the CMake module provided by the
`cmake_modules <http://wiki.ros.org/cmake_modules>`_ package.

When up update you must find_package cmake_modules before find_package Eigen. 
And add cmake_modules as a build_depend for your package.
