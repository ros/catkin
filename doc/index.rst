Catkin
======

`Catkin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catkin>`_ is a collection of
CMake macros and associated code used to build packages used in
`ROS <http://www.ros.org>`_.

It has been introduced as part of the
`Fuerte <http://ros.org/wiki/fuerte>`_ release where it was used for
a small set of base packages. For
`Groovy <http://ros.org/wiki/groovy>`_ it as been significantly
modified and is used by a large set of packages.

This version of the documentation is specific to the
`Groovy <http://ros.org/wiki/groovy>`_ release (or later).

Key benefits of catkin:

* Standard compliance (FHS, Cmake)
* Convenient and fast configuration of multiple projects
* Fast build of multiple projects
* Support for C++ and python projects
* Build-space can be used like an install-space (since groovy)
