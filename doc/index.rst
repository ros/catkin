Catkin
======

`Catkin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catkin>`_ is a collection of
CMake macros and associated code used to build packages used in
`ROS <http://www.ros.org>`_.

It was initially introduced as part of the
`Fuerte <http://ros.org/wiki/fuerte>`_ release where it was used for
a small set of base packages. For
`Groovy <http://ros.org/wiki/groovy>`_ it was significantly
modified, and used by many more packages.

This version of the documentation covers the `Groovy
<http://ros.org/wiki/groovy>`_ version and also Hydro, which is coming
soon.
